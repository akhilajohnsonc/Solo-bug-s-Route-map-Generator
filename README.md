Solo Bug's Route Map Generator
Navigation app that finds a route between two user-selected locations and detects whether that route intersects with a low clearance area like a bridge or overpass. If so, the app will automatically look for a new route that avoids the low clearance area.Developed using Direction API and Turf.js
