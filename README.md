Welcome, fellow coder, to the command center of Solo Bug's Route Map Generator! This isn't your regular GPS; it's a coding masterpiece that crafts routes and sidesteps low clearance obstacles like a ninja. Let's dive into the code and make your travels smooth as a well-optimized algorithm. 🚗💨


## Launch the Application 🚀

Witness the code enchantment firsthand! Launch the Solo Bug's Route Map Generator by visiting the [live app](https://akhilajohnsonc.github.io/Solo-bug-s-Route-map-Generator/) and let the code show you the way.

## How It Operates

Solo Bug's Route Map Generator is more than just lines on a map; it's lines of code that weave your journey. Powered by the Direction API and the logic of Turf.js, this app calculates your route with pinpoint accuracy. It doesn't stop there – it has a built-in "low clearance radar" to avoid bridges or overpasses that could block your coding expedition. 🌉🙅

## Features in Code Syntax

- **Route Magic:** Provide the "coordinates of wisdom," and watch the app cast a spell to conjure the most efficient route.
- **Bridge Dodging:** When a route finds a low clearance zone, the app takes a detour like a seasoned developer debugging a tricky bug.
- **Code-Savvy Interface:** The interface speaks fluent code; no manuals required.
